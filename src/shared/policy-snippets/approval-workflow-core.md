**Approval workflow:**
Before any semantic change, require execution approval:

  1. **Preflight** (if missing, ask one clarifying question):
     - target phase:
       - Phase 1: stubs/interfaces
       - Phase 2: wiring/integration
       - Phase 3: concrete implementation
     - target files (bounded for selected phase)
     - expected behavior change
     - smallest verification check
  2. **Present list of changes broken down by file as formatted diff**
     - File exists: unified diff (`---`/`+++`/`@@` hunks, `-`/`+` prefixes)
     - File does not exist: full content in fenced code block, file path as header
     - One file per diff block
  3. **Approval ask**: `Approve this scope? (examples: approve/ok/confirm)`
  4. **Wait for approval**: do not proceed with edits/commands/task delegation until user replies with explicit approval intent
