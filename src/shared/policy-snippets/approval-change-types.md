**Semantic changes** (require full execution approval):

- Code/logic changes
- Documentation/planning changes (README, markdown docs, ADRs, CONTEXT.md, runbooks, design notes), except typo-only fixes in non-code text files
- Config/schema changes (settings, env vars, build config)
- Dependency changes (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- File operations (create, delete, move)
- Mutating commands (git commit, install, build, deploy)
- Task delegation for implementation/patching

**Cosmetic changes** (require lightweight confirmation):

- Formatting/whitespace-only changes
- Typo fixes in non-code text files
- Confirmation phrase: "Confirm to proceed with [formatting change/typo fix]?"

**Edge cases:**

- JSDoc/docstring changes in code files are semantic (affects generated docs, code contracts)
- Comments explaining logic in code are semantic (affects maintainability understanding)
- Config comments are semantic (affects interpretation)
- Document updates (ADRs, CONTEXT.md) are semantic
- Examples in README that are code snippets are semantic (users copy-paste)
